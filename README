Alternative display of Moodle course. Uses YUI3 Library included with Moodle 2.0
 - Shows one topic/section at a time.
 - Animates between topics
 - loads each topic / section asynchronously (theoretically reducing perceived load time)
 - Adds option for background image
 - Adds option for custom activity icons
 - Includes a topics outline list with completion
 
 INSTALLATION
 Add the code to a directory called 'slides' in /course/format. So this file would be /course/format/slides/README
 Browse to notifications /admin/index.php to update the database
   2 new tables will be added
